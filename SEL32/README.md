# SEL Concept/32 

This simulator is running a test version of MPX-32 1.5E.  It is capable of creating a disk version of the O/S from a SDT tape.  The disk image can be booted, initialized, and run OPCOM.  Eight terminals can be used to access TSM via Telnet port 4747.  Much testing is still required.
