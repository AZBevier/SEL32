# Development Simulators.

This is a working copy of a simulator for the SEL Concept/32 computer.
The current test version is for the SEL 32/27, 32/67, 32/87, 32/97 computers.

# SEL Concept/32 

This simulator is running a test version of MPX-32 1.5E.  It is capable of
creating a disk image of the O/S from a SDT tape.  The disk image can be
booted, initialized, and run many of the MPX utilities; including OPCOM & TSM.
Eight terminals can be used to access TSM via Telnet port 4747.
More testing is still required.

mpxsdt4.tap - support for one 1GB SCSI disk and IOP 8 line terminals
mpxsdt5.tap - support for two 1GB SCSI disks and IOP 8 line terminals
mpxsdt6r.tap - support for 1 230KB DP02 disk and IOP 8 line terminals
